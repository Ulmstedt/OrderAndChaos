## What in the world is order and chaos?

> Order and Chaos is a variant of the game tic-tac-toe. It was introduced by Stephen Sniderman in Games Magazine in 1981.

> The game is unique in that both players, called Order and Chaos, control both Xs and Os. Order, going first, aims to get five like pieces in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) on the 6Ã—6 board, while Chaos aims to fill the board without completion of a line of five like pieces. If Order creates a line of six pieces, this is not counted as win.
